### 19/03/201
Refactored header and footer for easier maintance.  
Included full widht video in the back ground but still need to work out to make the rest the page scroll over it as per the original page.

## Ideas and plans
### BlackTree Studio
+ tabs across the top instead of hover menu
+ Equipment & Specs
    + accordion with multiple unfold at once option
### Studio Services
+ tabs across the top instead of hover menu
### BlackTree Mobile
+ tabs across the top instead of hover menu
### BlackTree Video
+ consildate the 2 sections into one
+ vidos selection as kind of slide show gallery view
### Testimonials
+ maybe a more scattered out layout instead of a list
    + could be done with a grid
### Sessions/Clients
+ a grid displaying a changing number of clients
    + might look better with elements not changing at the same time (separate update times)
    + will to be done with JavaSript with all clients in an arrays
    + need to make sure the same clients is not displayed in multiple elements at the same time
